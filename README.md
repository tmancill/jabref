# JabRef customized for IAAS

This branch offers a customization of JabRef for the IAAS.
In the future, we think of <https://customize.jabref.org> or offering the configurability of the changed options.
However, offering configurability only at the source has some charme -- see for example [dynamic window manager](http://dwm.suckless.org/).
